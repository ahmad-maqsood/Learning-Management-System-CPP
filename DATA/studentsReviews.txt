He explain concepts, like they make so much more sense. I honestly wish I had a teacher like him in my 1st semester, it would've made my foundation so much stronger. Just one request: right now the pace feels a little fast for me and I want to absorb everything properly.
good
Good Teacher
So so hai
Sir g love u ho gya
Sir taught us exceptionally well, especially by focusing on practical work that strengthened our concepts. His teaching style is clear, engaging, and very supportive. We learned a lot in his class.
In the very first class, I realized that this semester is going to be great. And it has been great so far. I wish we find more teachers like Sir Saeed, again.
My Best teacher so far in 3 semesters, focus on practical work with theory and always encourage us to be competent. Teach us like our big brother and always make us feel comfortable in class, feeks like studying with our friend.
Sir Saeed and oop are made for each other in my eyes. The way he explains the concepts and teaching us practically we really enjoy that. I hope we get more teachers like him in next semester.
Sir G Love You Hogeya, iss agay alfaz nahi hai.
